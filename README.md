## Upgrading the Fork

To keep the customized fork up-to-date with the latest changes from the original Excalith Start Page project, follow these steps:

1.  **Add the Upstream Remote:**
    Add the original Excalith repository as an upstream remote to my local fork:
    ```bash
    git remote add upstream https://github.com/excalith/excalith-start-page.git
    ```

2.  **Fetch Upstream Changes:**
    Fetch the latest changes from the upstream repository:
    ```bash
    git fetch upstream
    ```

3.  **Merge Changes:**
    To incorporate the upstream changes into my local `main` branch (or my primary branch), use a squash merge to keep my fork's history clean. Replace `vX.Y.Z` with the specific tag or branch you want to merge (e.g., `v3.1.5` as in the example below):
    ```bash
    git merge upstream/vX.Y.Z --squash --allow-unrelated-histories
    ```

    **Handling Merge Conflicts:**
    If there are conflicts (e.g., `CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in data/settings.json`), I will need to resolve them manually.
    *   Open the conflicted files in my editor (e.g., `data/settings.json`).
    *   Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`).
    *   Edit the file to combine the changes as desired, choosing which parts to keep from my fork and which from the upstream.
    *   After resolving conflicts, stage the changes:
        ```bash
        git add <conflicted-file-path>
        ```
    *   Then, commit the merged changes:
        ```bash
        git commit -m "Merge upstream vX.Y.Z into customized fork"
        ```
